            ~ Here at Homemade Donuts, we take pride in only using ingredients that you can recognize. 
            Our dough is made with a mix of flour, egg yolks, vanilla, shortening, baking powder, salt, 
            sugar, water, and yeast.  Our frosting and glazes are made with powdered sugar and organic 
            extracts.
            All of our donuts are made fresh daily by our staff. Please keep checking back here or on 
            our socials as we are constantly adding new flavors as well as gluten free, vegan and dairy-free 
            options. Enjoy! ~
